This is a Raspberry Pi Pico research machine I have build on a breadboard.
For hardware description read:

	doc/README-pico.txt

If you don't want to build a machine your self, there are ready fabricated
systems on PCB available, which can run the software. I have implemented
picosim also on these:

	https://github.com/udo-munk/RP2xxx-GEEK-80
	https://github.com/udo-munk/Pico-Eval-Board-80

To build the software you need to have the SDK 2.1.1 for RP2040/RP2350 devices
installed and configured. The SDK manual has detailed instructions how
to install on all major PC platforms, it is available here:

https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html

Now you can build picosim for the Pico RP2040 with these commands:

	cd z80pack/picosim/srcsim
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
	make -j

To build picosim for the Pico 2 RP2350 (you can also use
PICO_PLATFORM=rp2350-riscv if you have the appropriate RISC-V toolchain
installed):

	cd z80pack/picosim/srcsim
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -D PICO_PLATFORM=rp2350-arm-s -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
	make -j

The machine is configured for USB UART so that no additional parts are needed
to hook up a terminal. The default UART also is enabled, to use connect a
TTL/USB adapter or a pico probe to the default UART pins for the board
(GP0 & GP1).

This machine can be used with Pico and Pico W boards, it is setup
for a Pico board. To setup for a Pico W comment/uncomment the lines
in CMakeLists.txt. For connecting to WiFi the SSID and password are required,
for now they just get compiled in, and not read from MicroSD. To build
for a Pico W use these commands:

	cd z80pack/picosim/srcsim
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -G "UNIX Makefiles" -D WIFI_SSID='your WiFi SSID' -D WIFI_PASSWORD='your WiFi password'
	make -j

A Pico W tries to connect to WiFi and if that worked tries to get date/time via NTP
over the WiFi connection. So far this is protocolled on the console only, NTP time is
in UTC, needs conversion to local time and then this all must be glued into the application.
We might have two sources for date/time now, via NTP and from a RTC.

This also should work with a Pico 2 W, but has not been tested yet, need to get a board
sometime.

Preparing a MicroSD card:
In the root directory of the card create these directories:
CONF80
CODE80
DISKS80

Into the CODE80 directory copy all the .bin files from src-examples.
Into the DISKS80 directory copy the disk images from disks.
CONF80 is used to save the configuration, nothing more to do there,
the directory must exist though.

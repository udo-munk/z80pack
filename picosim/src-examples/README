This directory contains Z80/8080 code examples for the Pico Z80.
I have assembled the sources with z80asm from z80pack, but you
can use any Z80/8080 assembler of course.

With z80pack z80sim examples like these can be debugged under
control of an In Circuit Emulator (debug probe), the serial
port implemented in the latest release is identical.
You also can attach the ICE to this machine for debugging,
see sim.h for compiling options.

Copy the "example".bin files into a directory CODE80 on MicroSD card.

The examples are:
serial.bin	- shows how to do serial I/O
blink.bin	- blink builtin LED with Z80 port output

tb.bin		- 8080 TINY BASIC
micro80.bin	- 8080 Microchess
bas4k32.bin	- MITS Altair BASIC 4K V3.2, runs on 8080 only! p ff = 0
bas8k40.bin	- MITS Altair BASIC 8K V4.0, runs on 8080 only! p ff = 22
